chitter
=======

The exercise was the Week 6 challenge at Makers Academy.

The aim was to write a Twitter clone, called Chitter, that will allow users to post messages to a public stream.

The app has the following features:

- Sign up to Chitter
- Sign in to Chitter
- Sign out of Chitter
- View peeps whether logged in or not
- Post peeps if logged in

Bcrypt is used to secure the passwords, and DataMapper and Postgres are used to save the data.

Futher improvements to be made:

- Add functionality to reply to certain peeps
- Further refactoring of the code, including partials, and separating out helpers
- CSS developments to improve design
